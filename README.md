## 🫡 Acknowledgments

This Compiler supports Normal pico ducky as well as have support for [VexilonHacker](https://github.com/VexilonHacker/OverQuack) and my [OverQuack-Remastered](https://github.com/NikhilMunda/OverQuack-Remastered) DuckyScripts.

## Overview

This project is a powerful web-based Ducky Script compiler and payload generator designed to help penetration testers, hardware hackers, and enthusiasts create, validate, and generate payload files (`payload.oqs`) for Rubber Ducky-like devices.

It provides a professional IDE experience with a rich code editor, real-time syntax checking, advanced validation for Ducky scripting language, and downloadable compiled payload generation — all in a browser.

## Features

- **Monaco-based editor** with syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and error highlighting
- Supports both comment style orignal 'REM', 'REM_BLOCK', 'END_REM', Traditional Ducky comment and '//', '/*', '*/', C-style comment respectively. Example can be found at the live compiler. If your Ducky doesn't support C-style then my suggestion is please donot use C-style comment with your code.
- Full **syntax and semantic validation** of Ducky scripting commands and blocks
- Validation of **variables, functions, defines, and block structures**
- Color-coded, user-friendly **console** showing detailed compilation errors and warnings with line numbers
- Real-time **compilation status** and progress indication
- Support for most common Ducky script commands including mouse, keyboard, and control sequences
- Downloadable `.oqs` payload file generation after successful compilation
- Default example script to get started quickly

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- No installation or server backend required — fully client-side!

### Usage

1. Open the web application.
2. Write or paste your Ducky Script code into the editor.
3. Click **Compile & Validate** to check your code.
4. View the console output for errors or success messages.
5. If no errors, click **Generate payload.oqs** to download your compiled payload file.
6. Load this payload onto your target device for execution.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl + Enter`: Compile the script
- Standard editor shortcuts supported by Monaco

## Example Script

The editor loads a comprehensive sample demonstrating variables, functions, loops, conditionals, mouse & keyboard commands, and comments.
```
// Advanced Ducky Script Example - C-style comments
/* 
This demonstrates both comment styles
Multi-line C-style comment block 
*/

REM Traditional Ducky comment
VAR $username = "admin"
VAR $delay_time = 500

DEFINE $FAST_TYPE 50

FUNCTION open_notepad
  GUI r
  DELAY $delay_time
  STRING notepad    // Open notepad
  ENTER
  DELAY 1000
END_FUNCTION

IF $_CAPSLOCK_ON == 1
  CAPSLOCK
END_IF

open_notepad

STRING_BLOCK
Hello, this is a test
Written by: $username
Current delay: $delay_time ms
END_STRING

STRINGLN
DELAY $FAST_TYPE
STRING This line has a fast delay

MOUSE_MOVE 100 100
MOUSE_CLICK LEFT    // Click at position
DELAY 500

WHILE $delay_time > 100
  DELAY $delay_time
  $delay_time = $delay_time - 100
END_WHILE

/*
This is a C-style block comment
Multiple lines can go here
*/

REM_BLOCK
This is a traditional Ducky block comment
Both styles are supported
END_REM
```
